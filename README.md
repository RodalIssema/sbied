### Simulation-based Inference for Epidemiological Dynamics
#### [Course Notes](http://kingaa.github.io/sbied/)

These are notes from a short course given by Ed Ionides and Aaron King at the [Summer Institute in Statistics and Modeling in Infectious Diseases (SISMID)](http://sismid.uw.edu).
From the [main page](http://kingaa.github.io/sbied/), links lead to pages on a number of specific topics, culminating in four case studies that exemplify the methods and raise key issues.
For each such page, there is a corresponding **R** script, which contains the codes needed to recapitulate the calculations.
This script is a starting point for students to follow, explore, and modify the analysis according to their own curiosity and interest.
