subtitle: Advance Instructions
---

We are looking forward to seeing you in Seattle!
The course is fully subscribed and we are planning to fill the 2.5 days with both theoretical and practical material to help get you started using these exciting methods.

The schedule is quite full, so it is important that you take a little time to prepare yourself and your laptop.

**There are two important steps you *must* take to prepare for the course.**

1. Install or update **R**, **Rstudio**, the **pomp** package and the necessary dependent packages and compilers on your laptop.
   **There will be no time for this during the 2.5-day workshop.**
   You should be aware that the *installation instructions depend on the operating system you use*.
   Make sure you follow these instructions *carefully* and *thoroughly*!
   Make sure you follow the instructions to *test* your system before you are finished!

	In previous years, some students have come to the workshop, only to find that they cannot use their laptops because they have not followed the instructions carefully.
	It has been frustrating for them, and frustrating too for the rest of the class when we've wasted everyone's time troubleshooting the specific problems of one or two students.
	**Don't be one of those people!**
	Prepare your laptop, and contact Aaron (kingaa.sismid@gmail.com) if you run into difficulties you cannot solve.

	[The full installation instructions, which you should work through, are here](https://kingaa.github.io/sbied/prep/preparation.html).

2. If you are unfamiliar with **R**, work through the [**R** tutorial](https://kingaa.github.io/R_Tutorial/).
   Even if you have a bit of experience with **R**, this is a useful exercise: at least read through it and make sure all is familiar to you.

There will be no course materials in hardcopy: all the course materials are [available online](https://kingaa.github.io/sbied/).
