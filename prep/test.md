## Pre-test Questions

1. How did you hear about this module?
1. What do you hope to learn in this module?
1. Do you have a specific problem to which you think the techniques of the Simulation-based Inference module will apply? If so, please describe it briefly.
1. Please rate your level of experience as an **R** user. (1--5)
1. Please rate your level of experience as an **R** programmer. (1--5)
1. Please rate your level of experience with infectious disease dynamics.
1. Please rate your level of experience with time series analysis.
1. To the best of your ability, briefly describe the following concepts.
   It's OK to say that you don't know or aren't sure, if that's the case.
	(a) stochasticity
	(f) Euler's method
	(b) Markov process

## Post-test Questions

1. Recalling what you said in the pre-test, were you successful in learning what you hoped from this module?
1. If you indicated that you had a specific problem to which you thought the module's methods might apply, are you closer to understanding whether the methods will in fact apply?  If they do, do you see a path forward?
