Dear Module 7 Participant:

We are looking forward to meeting you and having a lively discussion on ***Simulation-based Inference for Epidemiological Dynamics***. We hope that you have been following the [instructions for preparing for the course](https://kingaa.github.io/sbied/prep/advance.html). Here, we will provide you some basic information about course logistics and ground rules for how we expect everyone to conduct themselves. These will help lessen the difficulties of online learning.

**Course logisitcs**

The course will have four components:

1. ***A mandatory self-learning component***, in which students are expected to watch the pre-recorded lecture prior to the live panel discussion that corresponds to the lecture. For example, before our live discussion panel on Wednesday, July 15, we expect students to have watched the lesson 1 and lesson 2 lecture videos. If you have any questions that come up while you are watching the videos, please use the #mod07simulationinference channel in the [SISMID Slack workspace](https://sismidworkspace.slack.com/) (to which you should all be invited by now via email - please let us know if you have not). We will be monitoring this channel and answering questions as soon as we can. We ask that you make an effort to ensure your question hasn't already been asked and answered.

2. ***A live discussion***, during which instructors will go over salient discussion points related to the mandatory video for the discussion. We will also allow students to raise any additional questions that did not come up on Slack. Please see the ground rules section below for expectations for how we expect everyone to conduct themselves. Specifically, we ask that you mute your audio and turn off your video for this component unless you have a question. If you unmute your audio and turn on your video, we will assume you have a question and give you the floor. At the end of the live discussion, the instructors will set the stage for the breakout group exercises.

3. ***Breakout group exercises***, in which each student will be assigned a Zoom breakout group of about 4 students, each of which will have a role. Having attended the live discussion for the lesson, students will be sent to these breakout groups to work on the exercises for the lesson. Within a breakout group, there will be four roles: coder, lecture-keeper, notetaker and reporter. Students will have the ability to request one of the instructors to enter the breakout room to provide assistance through the 'Ask for Help' feature. This is where we think students will get the most out of the course, so do not be shy. See the breakout room roles section below for the role details and the ground rules section for expectations.

4. ***Breakout group results***, in which the reporters of each breakout group report the results of their group.

**Ground rules**

The following are some specific rules that we have set in the spirit of ensuring a learning experience that is as smooth as possible.

1. ***During the live panel discussion, only turn your audio and video on for questions***.
Live panel discussions will be held over Zoom. Students are expected to mute themselves and turn off their video *unless they have a question.* If you have a question, unmute yourself and turn on your video, and this will act as a cue for us to call on you. The chat feature will be disabled during the live discussion.

2. ***During the breakout discussions, keep both your audio and video on.***
The breakout sessions will be where you apply the lessons you learn. In addition, you will have a specific role in your group. To facilitate full engagement, we expect your video and audio to be on for these sessions.

3. ***Be congnizant of distractions.***
During the time in which your audio and video are on, we expect you to extend professional courtesy to your colleagues and minimize any distracting sounds or images.

4. ***Speak up.***
We don't want to give the impression that we discourage free-flowing discussions during the live panel and breakout discussions. On the contrary, we hope you see these protocols as the foundation upon which we can all build a productive and engaging conversation about the topics of the course. As such, we expect you to turn in as many questions as you have on Slack while you watch the pre-recorded lectures as well as voice any relevant questions or thoughts that come up during the live panel sessions.

**Breakout room roles.**

1. ***Coder***: this person will take input from all team members and code up the solution to the exercises.

2. ***Lecture-keeper***: this person will be the point person in directing the group's attention to the most relevant parts of the lecture video and slides for the exercises.

3. ***Notetaker***: this person will take note of the discussions (whether or not they end up being the final takeaways) and results of the group.

4. ***Reporter***: this person will report the results of the group to the larger classroom when we all come back together and discuss results.
