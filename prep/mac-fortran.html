<h2 id="instructions-for-installing-gfortran-on-macosx">Instructions for installing <em>gfortran</em> on MacOSX</h2>
<h3 id="osx-10.10-yosemite-users">OSX 10.10 (Yosemite) users</h3>
<p>Make sure you have <code>Xcode</code> installed. This can be downloaded from the App Store or from https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/.</p>
<p>Open a terminal window and execute</p>
<pre><code>xcode-select --install</code></pre>
<p>This should have the result of installing command-line versions of all the tools you'll need to compile C and FORTRAN code. To test it, run the <a href="./preparation.html">installation and test scripts</a>.</p>
<p>If these still don't work, complaining about a lack of FORTRAN support, try installing <code>gfortran</code> as shown in the instructions below for older versions of the OS.</p>
<h3 id="osx-10.9-and-older">OSX 10.9 and older</h3>
<p>Make sure you have <code>Xcode</code> installed. It is available at https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/. You may need to follow the &quot;Additional Tools&quot; link to find an older version of <code>Xcode</code>.</p>
<p>The following is based on the <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/tools">instructions given on the <em>R</em> website</a>.</p>
<p>To install <code>gfortran</code> in your user space in such a way that it can be easily removed later, download and run the <code>mac-fortran.sh</code> script from the course website by opening a terminal and executing</p>
<pre><code>curl -O http://kingaa.github.io/sbied/prep/mac-fortran.sh
sh mac-fortran.sh</code></pre>
<p>This will download and unpack a new version of <code>gfortran</code>, putting it into a new directory: <code>~/gfortran</code>. It will also put a <code>Makevars</code> file into your <code>~/.R</code> directory so that <code>R</code> knows where to look when it wants <code>gfortran</code>.</p>
<p>If it works, you should be able to run the <a href="./preparation.html">installation and test scripts</a>.</p>
