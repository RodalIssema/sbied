## Exercise

Suppose a PanelPOMP model has all its parameters unit-specific. Is there anything useful to be gained from the PanelPOMP structure, or is it preferable to analyze the data as a collection of POMP models?

-------------

## Solution

A PanelPOMP model with all parameters unit-specific is identical to a collection of independent POMP models. There may not be anything to be gained by using the PanelPOMP framework in this case, except perhaps that the **panelPomp** package can help with the book-keeping for working with the collection of panels.

One can expect an overhead from using **panelPomp** software when the simpler **pomp** software is sufficient.

PanelPOMP models with all unit-specific parameters can be used to test **panelPomp** methodology against **pomp** methodology since the latter also applies in this special case.
