* Since a PanelPOMP is a collection of independent POMP models, they can each be filtered separately.

* The `pfilter` method for class `panelPomp` does exactly this, after extracting the parameter vector for each unit from the shared and unit-specific parameters belonging to the `panelPomp` object.

```{r}
contacts <- panelPompExample(pancon)
pf <- pfilter(contacts,Np=100)
class(pf)
class(unitobjects(pf)[[1]])
```
